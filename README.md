Here's a revised and professional **project plan** for an **Athlete Toolkit** application, refactored from the original "Niezbędnik Ucznia" idea.

---

## 🎯 **MVP Goal**
Build a desktop application that allows athletes to:
- Log and track workouts and nutrition
- Monitor performance statistics
- Export training logs and stats
- Register securely and store personal performance data encrypted
- Access it all through a clean GUI interface

---

## 🧱 **High-Level Architecture**
```
[GUI Frontend] ←→ [App Logic (Controllers)] ←→ [Database via ORM]
      ↑                                         ↓
 [PDF/CSV Export]                        [Encrypted User Data]
```

### Components:
1. **Frontend (GUI)** – For workout/nutrition input and viewing stats
2. **Core Logic** – Training session tracking, statistics generation
3. **Database Layer** – ORM-based persistence
4. **Export Module** – Workout logs, nutrition, and stats to PDF/CSV
5. **Security** – User login, hashed credentials, encrypted performance data

---

## 🧰 **Suggested Tech Stack**
| Layer           | Technology           |
|----------------|----------------------|
| GUI            | Tkinter or PyQt5     |
| ORM            | SQLAlchemy           |
| DB Engine      | SQLite               |
| Security       | `bcrypt`, `cryptography` |
| Export         | `reportlab` for PDF, `csv` for CSV |
| Documentation  | `pdoc`, `Sphinx`, `wkhtmltopdf` |
| Charts (Optional) | `matplotlib` or `plotly` |
| Version Control| Git + GitHub         |

## 📌 **Task Breakdown**

### 🔐 User Authentication
- [ ] Register/login (secure passwords + encrypted data)
- [ ] Store user profile (age, height, weight, goals)

### 🏋️ Training Log
- [ ] Log daily workouts (type, duration, intensity, notes)
- [ ] Track strength/power/cardio metrics
- [ ] Edit/delete past entries
- [ ] Export to PDF/CSV

### 🍽️ Nutrition Log (Optional in MVP)
- [ ] Log meals/macros
- [ ] View weekly/daily calorie intake
- [ ] Export to PDF/CSV

### 📊 Statistics
- [ ] Weekly/monthly training volume
- [ ] Average workout intensity
- [ ] Progress over time (e.g., PR tracking)
- [ ] Graphs for visualization

### 📂 Export Modules
- [ ] Training log to PDF/CSV
- [ ] Stats summary to PDF

### 💾 Persistence Layer
- [ ] Models: User, WorkoutLog, (NutritionEntry - optional)
- [ ] Encrypt user profile data
- [ ] ORM setup and migrations

### 📘 Documentation
- [ ] Docstrings and API docs
- [ ] PDF documentation generated with `pdoc` or `Sphinx`

### 🚀 Deployment
- [ ] Package with pyinstaller
- [ ] Push code and docs to GitHub

---

## 📈 **Development Steps**

### Week 1 – Setup & Auth
- Project scaffolding + virtual environment
- User registration/login (bcrypt + cryptography)
- Basic GUI setup

### Week 2 – Workout Log
- GUI to add/edit workouts
- Connect workout model to DB
- List/display workout entries

### Week 3 – Stats + Export
- Aggregate stats (training volume, PRs)
- PDF/CSV export for logs and stats
- Optional: Add graphing

### Week 4 – Finalize & Docs
- Refine GUI
- Polish features
- Generate docs (PDF)
- Push final version to GitHub

Let me know if you want:
- A Python boilerplate to get started
- A GitHub-ready starter repo
- A specific UI flow design or mockup

I can also provide code examples for any module on request.
